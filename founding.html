        <div class="col-md-6"><p class="description">Sony was founded in 1946. A group of 20 led by Masaru Ibuku founded Sony to embark on a goal to "do what has never been done before". Masaru Ibuku was the founder and chief advisor of Sony. He stated the purpose of Sony: "Establish an ideal factory that stresses a spirit of freedom and open mindedness that will, through technology, contribute to Japanese culture". The company only started with 190,000 yen, which is approximately $1,300 USD. Despite having little resources to start with, they knew that with determination and hard work it would be possible to achieve remarkable things.
          Masaru Ibuku wrote a lengthy prospectus to outline the goals and values of Sony. One of Ibuku's values was he believed it was important for all the workers and contributors of Sony to be happy. He concluded that people are at their best when they are motivated and happy with their situation. He strived to make Sony a helpful and ideal. Another value of Sony was to create technology that would better people's lives. Ibuku also laid out a plan for Sony to become successful, he made it imperative that working as a team and as a family would ultimately achieve their goals.  </p>
